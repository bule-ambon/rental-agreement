- User request: "The goal of this project is to draft a really good rental agreement. Let's draft it in markdown and put it in \"drafts/agreement.md\". The property is 22723 John Rolfe Ln, Katy TX 77449. Leave placeholders for landlord and tenant names for now. For the first iteration, use the document that starts with Residential_Lease_Agreement as the guide. I like the tone of the language and the brevity of that document. Then, create in the same drafts folder a \"considerations.md\" and go through the other two sample lease agreements and make a list of things that those agreements address which are not addressed yet in \"agreement.md\""
- User confirmation: "confirmed"
- Actions: Created `drafts/agreement.md` based on the Residential_Lease_Agreement tone with placeholders and the provided property address; created `drafts/considerations.md` listing topics from the other sample agreements not covered in the draft; updated `tasks/todo.md` progress.
