List items you DO want included in `drafts/agreement.md`, even if they do not appear in sample agreements:

- Yard maintenance is Tenant's responsibility; Tenant must maintain the lawn and driveway to avoid HOA deed restriction violations.
- Include smoke detector requirements based on the Tayloe house agreement (testing, battery replacement, written requests for inspection/installation/repair).
